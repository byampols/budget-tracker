# budget-tracker

## Description
A progressive web application that allows the user to track their budget. Due to an unknown bug, the application currently only works on localhost, and the deployed version on Heroku has mysterious errors that after hours of bugfixing I couldn't fix. Feel free to let me know if you have any advice.
